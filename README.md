# tetris
This is an ascii version of the popular video game tetris. It is solely programmed in C++ (revision 17) using my own custom console wrapper that implements double-buffer rendering to the windows console.

The project was an assignment and the respective paper (written in danish) is also available in the repo (rapport.pdf), this includes benchmarks and explaination of the game logic.

Thanks to @Justas Masiulis for nitpicking some parts of the code
